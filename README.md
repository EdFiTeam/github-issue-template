## Need
> Provides instant __context and awareness__ upon scanning. It's a high-level justification of effort stripped of technical details, that can be grasped by both technical and product people. Remember, we're building features, not _code._ Better yet, we're creating __value for the user.__

## Deliverables
> The most important part of the issue. They should determine the __scope of the issue__ and provide __testable assumptions.__ Deliverables should be clear & concise expectations, in the form of bullet points, for which both a manual and an automated test can be made. Together they form the technical definition of the issue.

## Solution
> __The plan.__ One should never embark on any endeavor w/out __taking every aspect of it into consideration beforehand.__ This does not mean obtaining a complete bulletproof implementation in pseudocode. It means anticipating every single step needed for completing the issue, mentally, by confrunting directly w/ relevant code. Only by __planning from one end to another, before typing any line of code__ can the implementation time of an issue be realistically estimated.

#### TODOs
> The __logical steps__ required for completing this issue should be listed chronologically, using checkable bullet points, to be tackled one after another.

#### Files
> Making a list of the files involved in completing this issue serves in more ways. It helps define the __scope__, provides quick __orientation__ and tells which areas of the repository should one be comfortable w/ before starting to implement.

#### Notes
> __Personal insights__ from previous experience can be real time-savers. Take a note of __peculiar aspects__ relevant to the implementation of this issue. Linking to relevant __documentation__ is also of great value for newcomers.
